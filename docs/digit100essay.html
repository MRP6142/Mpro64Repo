        <p class="essay">Coding is never easy for the average human. There is a bunch when it comes to learning how to work with code. 
        It all comes down to the basics when one wants to begin. However, there really is no "basic" for coding, but there are a bunch of ways to start code.
        The biggest of challenges when it comes to learning code as a beginner is seeing how much work it is. It can cause stress, but it is usually best to work with one and then the other.<br></br>
        A big key challenge when it comes to setting up is definitely trying to figure out of how the terminal works when it comes to doing git commands.
        The issue with this is that if you want to build and push a website and publish it when it is created, these git commands and sometimes general commands are a requirement for building a Github website.
        Now the again, this is not that big of deal because it is easy to just google how to work with setting up a Github repo. The only two languages needed for just a simple website is HTML and CSS. Both are relatively easy for beginners to understand.
        That is what this specific site was made with, just HTML and CSS. Quite frankly, there was no reason for using other languages in this.<br></br>
        What has not been mentioned is Penn State University's wordpress site making. This is a website builder mainly for those that do not understand code. What that means is that it does most of the code for you.
        If you wanted to put in text in the home page of this site, it will already put in specific HTML elements fo whatever your typing in. It is way simpler then to actually code it.
        Setting this up does not take that long either. Just login, and create a site, and boom setup already done. This all sounds good on paper, but just like Github, it also has its share of problem, most of which are very minor.
        However the biggest one comes when it actually gives you a lot less freedom with the CSS. What it is ment by that is the fact that there is almost little to no freedom when it comes to making a site on this platform.
        If the site that an individual is creating does not offer a good theme that the individual wants, that individual will not make it and try to code it manually. <br></br>
        As for me personally, I would much rather make a site with actually code manually. Finger by finger, pressing keys to build the element of my choice. That gives more freedom to code how much you want to have.
        Now a lot of this comes to learn a lot of understanding of new things to learn. I want to actually start learning how JavaScript works and maybe some Python. As those are languages that give a website a functionality.
        HTML is a language to represent the content of the website. CSS is a form of stylizing that content from the HTML code.<br></br>
        Coding will always be a bundle of joy in my heart. While it is not for everyone, it can become easy once an individual gets used to knwoing how each code runs and operates. If someone wants to build the website manually, by all means go for it.
        If someone wants to build it off of a site that automatically makes the code for you, then go ahead and do it. It is all about knowing what works best for that someone.</p>
