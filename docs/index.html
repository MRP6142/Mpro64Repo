        <p>"Life is like a rock. Sometimes it will just not move. That is until you do something to that rock, 
        that rock needs to be pushed. Quite literally, life needs to be pushed to be moved. If its not moving,
        then it will stay still, not doing anything unless you do something. Every humans life has to be pushed to 
        extreme limits. That is what I had to do for myself and look where I am now. Everyone else has potential if they abuse it properly.
        I am still trying to do exactly that. If nothing is moving, nothing will change and so you are the only one
        who can make that change happy." - Mario Provenzano, 2023</p>
