       <p>This page is made for a game analysis project. The game is called The Good People.</p>
       <img src="images/goodpeople1.png" class="img" alt="white screen with text"/> 
        
       <p>This game is a form of a text adventure. It means you got text on the bottom to click on and it will send you to a different page. <br></br>
       The game is quite short, only 1 hour worth of content. Not that there is much since its just text on a screen with some images here and there. <br></br>
       Leans heavily with some horror and weird fiction. You play as two main characters that explore a sunken village that is haunted under a dam that has been re-emerged. <br></br>
       The horror aspect is ment to be a physcological horror, not really jumpscares, screams, scary music, etc. <br></br>
       The narrative is fragmented and dreamlike with memories, loss, and the unknown. <br></br>
       This game is great and would highly recommend this if you are into physcological horror or weird fiction short stories. <br></br>
       BE WARNED: This game gets disturbing fairly quickly and the game is quite linear.</p>
